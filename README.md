# Rack-Controller
A system to add custom smaller Parts to a Rack for a variety of use-cases

## Idea
The general idea is to have a controller node that mananges all the power and acts as a central
hub for the entire system. You then connect smaller more specific breakout/extension boards to that
controller to actually fulfill your goals.

## Controller
The Controller acts as a Hub for all the extension boards you want in your overall system. The
Controller is responsible for distributing power to all the extensions and controlling/gathering
information

## Extensions
Extensions are breakout boards that allow you to add new features
